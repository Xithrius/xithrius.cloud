This was originally at [Xithrius/TODO](https://github.com/Xithrius/TODO) on GitHub, but that was boring so I decided to move it here for now while I construct another part of the site for a TODO listing.

Pulled directly from my brain. If you have suggestions, [create an issue](https://github.com/Xithrius/TODO/issues/new).

### 2022 Objectives (made before the year starts):

- [ ] A year-long contribution streak (attempts: 1), even if it's 1 commit a day on this TODO repository
- [x] [Create a website with multiple subdomains for different services](https://github.com/Xithrius/xithrius.cloud)
- [ ] Complete one of the years for [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/) (before the 2022 event starts)
- [ ] Survive

### Projects:

- [x] Create own [polybar theme/config](https://github.com/Xithrius/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/polybar)
- [x] [Rust TUI template repository](https://github.com/Xithrius/rust-tui-project-template)
- [ ] A website which counts towards Y3K
- [ ] Daily weather by some means of notification
- [x] Get CD working on a VPS
