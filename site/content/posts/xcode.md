I used xcode for a course around half a year ago, and I forgot to write down my complaints, so here they are.

Enjoy.

1. Not having different keybind layouts by default like vscode, atom, intellij, etc
2. Where is the code formatter
3. Ctrl + x only cuts if you select the line
4. There is no intuitive way to close a pane
5. Test coverage is in the log tab, and not the test tab
6. Is the current file/project in spaces or tabs? I can't tell
7. Coverage doesn't tell you what part of the line you didn't cover, it just tells you the entire line isn't covered
8. I can't change the size of the UI
9. Creating a folder is called "create group"
10. Can't switch tabs with `ctrl + tab` or `ctrl + shift + tab`
11. Won't tell you when a variable isn't being used, but will tell you if it's not modified
