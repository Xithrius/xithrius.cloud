Using a [gradient generator](https://github.com/Xithrius/Xythrion/blob/main/xythrion/extensions/image_generation/gradients.py#L67-L95) in my Discord bot, I simply ran the command

```
\gradient (218,80,66) (198,75,157) 384 384 h
```

to output the following:

![New icon](/images/posts/change-of-icon/new-icon.png)

Nice.
