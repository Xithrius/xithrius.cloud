If you'd like to see my dotfiles, [here they are](https://github.com/Xithrius/dotfiles). This repository is not updated often, so configs may be outdated.

Either way, here's a bunch of different items that I customize my Arch install with.

# [i3wm](https://github.com/i3/i3)

A tiling window manager, since minimalism is cool.

Why not [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3)? You waste space on your monitor(s). Although it is cool to look at, and I have nothing against it if you have too much monitor.

You can find a bunch of useful tips and such on the Arch Linux Wiki [i3 page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/I3).

# [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)

It looks nicer than i3-bar, or i3-status.

You can find themes in the [polybar-themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes) repository.

# [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)

The default launcher for i3 is sufficient for launching programs, but I wanted to have a keybind for connecting to ssh servers, or switching to a different workspace by searching for a window name.

# [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)

Another terminal emulator. This one's pretty darn fast, and I had to decide between it and [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty). I eventually settled with Kitty for the ligature support.

# [fish-shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)

The shell that I use within kitty. Since functions are so easy to make, with a [large amount of in-depth documentation](https://fishshell.com/), I wish I found this repository sooner.

Along with this, I recommend using [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship), since it makes the prompt that much better.

# [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)

Of course this had to be said. I really like using neovim, but I keep running into issues with not understanding how to configure things properly.

Once I get a working setup that I'm satisfied with, I'll update my dotfiles, linked at the top of this page.

For now, I'm using [vscode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode). The extensions and settings that I have configured can be found [here](https://blog.xithrius.cloud/posts/vscode-settings).

# Ending notes

In the future, I may create a blog with a step-by-step guide on how to get all of this working together.

If I really feel like a tutorial is necessary, I may end up creating a video and posting it on YouTube for visual demonstrations.
