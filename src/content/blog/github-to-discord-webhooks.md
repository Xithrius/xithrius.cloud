Since I keep losing the official post from Discord, [here it is](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).

If you'd like a fancy embed every time a GitHub Actions workflow completes, use [SebastiaanZ's](https://github.com/SebastiaanZ/) [github-status-embed-for-discord](https://github.com/SebastiaanZ/github-status-embed-for-discord) workflow.
